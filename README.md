<h2>These are the projects I have worked on:</h2>

 - [Grandma Wrestling](https://github.com/GonzaloJMora/GrandmaWrestling)
   - A wacky local multiplayer party game that pits four grandmothers in an arena where they have to fight each other to see who will come out the victor.
   - Special chaos elements come into play as the grandmas try to knock each other off of the arena to cause mayhem.
- [Pillbox Game Engine](https://github.com/CollinScott37/Pillbox)
  - Implemented an A* pathfinding algorithm to a classmate's custom game engine in order to have a character traverse a maze towards multiple goals efficiently.
- [Gengine Game Engine](https://github.com/GonzaloJMora/Gengine)
  - A custom game engine made for a class using C++ with support for Lua scripting available as well.
- [VR Bowling](https://github.com/GonzaloJMora/fantasy-bowling)
  - A simple tech demo made for a class that allows the player to play a round of bowling in VR. On top of being able to play a normal round, the player can swap out for different pin types, ball types, and formations of pins to mix up the game.
- [Small miscellaneous games made in MicroStudio](https://gonzalojmora.github.io/cs325-game-prototypes/)
  - A collection of a few minor games/prototypes that I worked on that have simple gameplay. Each was made in about a week.
- [Web Scraper](https://github.com/GonzaloJMora/webScraper)
  - I worked on the backend of this scraper that would allow for the user to input the names of items to search for in three websites (CraigsList, Bookoo, and ClassifiedAds) and display the data of found items to the user.
  - Important Note: Due to some technical difficulties in obtaining the original repository, all that is located in the given repo is the video demo of the application at the moment.
- [Flipside](https://github.com/GonzaloJMora/Flipside)
  - A short game I made in a week on my own before having much knowledge in game design and programming. A simple rage platformer that uses the left and right arrow keys to move, up arrow to jump, and the spacebar to flip gravity. This is a more archaic project of mine, but working on this game allowed me to learn the basics.
